      <h3>Why Programming?:</h3>
      <p>I first thought of getting into programming as a junior in high school but I wasn't sure if I would like it. 
        I then saw that Kirkwood was offering some programming classes through their dual enroll program, 
        which allowed for college classes to be taken in high school for both high school and college credits. 
        So, to see if I liked programming, I enrolled in Intro to Programming Logic and Fundamentals of Web Design for my 
        first semester of my senior year. After only the first day of having these classes, 
        I knew that programming is what I wanted to do. 
        Looking back, the decision to take these classes was probably the best decision I've ever made.</p>
